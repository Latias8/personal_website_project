{"title":"Handling, specifically the steering!","message":"So I've started this new lil' racing project.\nI won't spill the whole plan just yet, but I'll keep posting small devlogs to share a thing or two :>\n\nI've been hard at work on just the handling and feel of the vehicle so far. Most of the work has gone into the steering!\n\nThe two bars at the bottom of the gif below with the moving rectangles visually represent the current orientation of the front wheels (top bar) and the current mouse input (bottom bar // mouse input because the car is steered with the mouse, not directional keys).\n\nThe most prominent perk of the steering is the anti-steer mechanic. It's calculated by how fast the car is going, what direction the car itself is facing, and what direction the car is moving in. The faster the speed and the higher the angle between the direction the car face and moves, the stronger the wheels will veer in the opposite direction of the turn.\n\nIt's really handy!\n\nAnother addition to the steering is a small dead zone in the center of either bar. The idea is that so long as the mouse input is in the center with a small left and right threshhold, the car's wheels will stay straight. It works, but doesn't have the results in assisting with driving that I thought it would... not yet at least!\n\nI did try to expand upon the idea and have the anti-steer come in whenever the mouse was within that threshhold and align the car with the direction it's moving in (since after turns keeping the wheels straight won't immediately stop the car from continuing to turn in that direction a little bit), but had no luck so far. I think I'll give it another shot another time though!\n\n","date":"22/04/2024, 17:14:04","loggif":"devl1.gif"}
